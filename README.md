# object_oriented_oriented_quiz
🧠 Quiz Game – OOP-Based Python Project
This project is a simple True/False quiz game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It presents a set of 12 questions to the user, who responds with either True or False. After each answer, the game gives instant feedback and updates the user's score.

This project was developed as part of the “100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023” by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It was designed to apply the OOP concepts taught in the course through a fun and interactive mini-project.

📌 Features
🧾 12 True/False trivia questions

⚡ Real-time feedback and score tracking

🎯 Clean and modular code architecture using OOP

💻 Simple command-line interface

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

🧩 OOP Concepts Demonstrated
Classes and Objects

Encapsulation

Separation of Concerns

Modularity and Reusability

🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to reinforce the understanding of core OOP principles by applying them in a real-world scenario. It helps learners structure code more effectively and maintainably using classes and logic separation.

This mini-game is especially useful for Python beginners who want to bridge the gap between theory and practical application of object-oriented design.
